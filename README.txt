Caches WordPress menus to improve loading time.

== Description ==

Caches WordPress menus to improve loading time.

If you are using user-specific dynamic menu items (for example, certain Conditions from the Conditionals Extension), this plugin will break that functionality, as it will cache the state of the first page load and any changes will not be seen. There is no per-user cache.
